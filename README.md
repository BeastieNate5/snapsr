# About
**Snapsr** is a lightweight CLI tool that lets you take snapshots of your custom file setups and easily restore them later. Define which files to track in a simple config, save a snap, and Snapsr will archive the current state of those files. When you restore a snap, it restores everything tracked backto its original location, making it perfect for quickly switching between desktop ricing setuos, development environments, or configuration profiles

### Key Features:
- Save and load mutiple namped snaps
- Automatically restores files to their original paths
- Manage multiple setups (perfect for ricing, dev environments, or config testing)

Use Snapsr to version, switch, and experiment with different setups. Without overwriting your current work
